>The objective of this project is to develop an intelligent system to manage the ignition of the wifi terminals according to the number of users present. This system is based on an artificial neural network implemented on a server connected to a network switch. The ignition of a terminal is based on specific parameters of the terminals allowing to define if the use of the terminal is indispensable or not.
